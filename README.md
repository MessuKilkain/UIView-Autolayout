UIView-Autolayout
=================

Category on UIView to simplify the creation of common layout constraints. The code is described and introduced in [this blog post](http://commandshift.co.uk/blog/2013/02/20/creating-individual-layout-constraints/).

Here's the API documentation [on Cocoadocs](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/UIView-Autolayout/0.1.0/Categories/UIView+AutoLayout.html).

The demo project is most of the way towards drawing a robot made of views arranged using all the category methods:
